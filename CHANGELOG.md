## 🐛 Major Fixes Applied

### ✅ Issue 1: Hydration Errors
**Problem**: Server/client rendering mismatches with CSS classes
**Solution**: Refactored MessageBubble component to avoid SSR conflicts

### ✅ Issue 2: Expert Search Not Working  
**Problem**: Answer conversion used wrong question keys
**Solution**: Fixed `expertFilter.ts` to use correct field names:
```typescript
// Fixed mapping
answers.destination_main → request.destination
answers.activities → improved regex parsing with emojis
answers.party_type → request.traveler_type
answers.fitness_level → request.experience_level
```

### ✅ Issue 3: Question 19 Layout Problems
**Problem**: Multi-select activities had poor layout, misaligned Continue button
**Solution**: 
- Changed grid from `grid-cols-1` to `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-1`
- Improved button styles with better padding and animations
- Fixed "Other" option to show proper text input

### ✅ Issue 4: Avatar Display Issues
**Problem**: Showing placeholder instead of real Alfie avatar
**Solution**: Added proper Alfie avatar image at `/images/alfie-avatar.png`

### ✅ Issue 5: Loading Animation Issues
**Problem**: Too fast fact changes, duplicate text
**Solution**: 
- Slowed down facts rotation from 3s to 5s
- Added beautiful loading animation with travel facts
- Removed duplicate loading messages

## 🧪 Testing Tools Created

### 1. Expert Testing Page (`/test-experts`)
5 predefined scenarios for quick expert system testing:
- 🏔️ Adventure in Nepal (hiking, solo, intermediate)
- 🏝️ Family Trip to Bali (swimming, families, beginner)  
- 🎿 Swiss Alps Adventure (skiing, couples, advanced)
- 🦘 Australia Backpacking (hiking, solo, intermediate)
- 🌸 Japan Cultural Tour (cultural tours, couples, beginner)

### 2. Console Logging
Detailed logs for debugging:
```
🔍 Expert search API called with request: {...}
📥 Loading experts from Airtable...
✅ Loaded 45 experts from Airtable
🎯 Running expert matching algorithm...
🎉 Found 3 matching experts
```

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=patt...
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=apptAJxE6IudBH8fW
AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID=tblgvgDuQm20rNVPV
```

### Installation & Running
```bash
cd outdoorable-widget
npm install
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

## 📊 Expert System Architecture

### Current Implementation (v1)
```
User Answers → expertFilter.ts → 5-Step Algorithm → Airtable API → Results
```

**5 Filtering Steps:**
1. **Geography**: Match destination to Location_Tags
2. **Activities**: Parse activities and match to Activity_Tags  
3. **Traveler Type**: Map party type to Traveler_Tags
4. **Experience Level**: Convert fitness level to Expertise_Tags
5. **Languages**: Detect languages for Language_Tags

### Known Limitations
- **Hardcoded synonym mappings** - limited flexibility
- **Manual field mapping** - prone to errors
- **Static tag relationships** - doesn't adapt to new combinations
